## Introduction

Number fields are provided in Nemo by Antic. This allows construction of
absolute number fields and basic arithmetic computations therein.

Number fields are constructed using the `AnticNumberField` function. However,
for convenience we define

```
NumberField = AnticNumberField
```

so that number fields can be constructed using `NumberField` rather than
`AnticNumberField`. 

The types of number field elements in Nemo are given in the following table,
along with the libraries that provide them and the associated types of the
parent objects.

 Library | Field                          | Element type  | Parent type
---------|--------------------------------|---------------|---------------------
Antic    | $\mathbb{Q}[x]/(f)$            | `nf_elem`     | `AnticNumberField`

All the number field types belong to the `Field` abstract type and the number
field element types belong to the `FieldElem` abstract type.

## Number field constructors

In order to construct number field elements in Nemo, one must first construct
the number field itself. This is accomplished with one of the following
constructors.

```@docs
AnticNumberField(::fmpq_poly, ::AbstractString)
```

```@docs
AnticCyclotomicField(::Int, ::AbstractString, AbstractString)
```

```@docs
AnticMaximalRealSubfield(::Int, ::AbstractString, ::AbstractString)
```

For convenience we define

```
NumberField = AnticNumberField
CyclotomicField = AnticCyclotomicField
MaximalRealSubfield = AnticMaximalRealSubfield
```

so that one can use the names on the left instead of those on the right.

Here are some examples of creating number fields and making use of the
resulting parent objects to coerce various elements into those fields.

```
R, x = PolynomialRing(QQ, "x")
K, a = NumberField(x^3 + 3x + 1, "a")
L, b = CyclotomicField(5, "b")
M, c = MaximalRealSubfield(5, "c", "y")

d = K(3)
f = L(b)
g = L(ZZ(11))
h = L(ZZ(11)//3)
k = M(x)
```

## Number field element constructors

Once a number field is constructed, there are various ways to construct
elements in that field.

Apart from coercing elements into the number field as above, we offer the
following functions.

```@docs
zero(::AnticNumberField)
```

```@docs
one(::AnticNumberField)
```

```@docs
gen(::AnticNumberField)
```

The easiest way of constructing number field elements is to use element
arithmetic with the generator, to construct the desired element by its
representation as a polynomial. See the following examples for how to do this.

Here are some examples of constructing number field elements.

```
R, x = PolynomialRing(QQ, "x")
K, a = NumberField(x^3 + 3x + 1, "a")

b = zero(K)
c = one(K)
d = gen(K)
f = a^2 + 2a - 7
```

## Basic functionality

The following basic functionality is provided by the default number field
implementation in Nemo, to support construction of generic rings over number
fields. Any custom number field implementation in Nemo should provide these 
functions along with the usual arithmetic operations.

```
parent_type(::Type{nf_elem})
```

Gives the type of the parent object of an Antic number field element.

```
elem_type(R::AnticNumberField)
```

Given the parent object for a number field, return the type of elements
of the field.

```
Base.hash(a::nf_elem, h::UInt)
```

Return a `UInt` hexadecimal hash of the number field element $a$. This should
be xor'd with a fixed random hexadecimal specific to the number field type. The
hash of the coefficients of the number field element representation should be
xor'd with the supplied parameter `h` as part of computing the hash.

```
deepcopy(a::nf_elem)
```

Construct a copy of the given number field element and return it. This function
must recursively construct copies of all of the internal data in the given
element. Nemo number field elements are mutable and so returning shallow copies
is not sufficient.

```
mul!(c::nf_elem, a::nf_elem, b::nf_elem)
```

Multiply $a$ by $b$ and set the existing number field element $c$ to the
result. This function is provided for performance reasons as it saves
allocating a new object for the result and eliminates associated garbage
collection.

```
mul_red!(c::nf_elem, a::nf_elem, b::nf_elem, red::Bool)
```

Multiply $a$ by $b$ and set the existing number field element $c$ to the
result. Reduction modulo the defining polynomial is only performed if `red` is
set to `true`. Note that $a$ and $b$ must be reduced. This function is provided
for performance reasons as it saves allocating a new object for the result and
eliminates associated garbage collection.

```
reduce!(x::nf_elem)
```

Reduce the given number field element by the defining polynomial, in-place.
This only needs to be done after accumulating values computed by `mul_red!`
where reduction has not been performed. All standard Nemo number field
functions automatically reduce their outputs.

```
addeq!(c::nf_elem, a::nf_elem)
```

In-place addition. Adds $a$ to $c$ and sets $c$ to the result. This function
is provided for performance reasons as it saves allocating a new object for
the result and eliminates associated garbage collection.

Given the parent object `R` for a number field, the following coercion
functions are provided to coerce various elements into the number field.
Developers provide these by overloading the `call` operator for the number
field parent objects.

```
R()
```

Coerce zero into the number field.

```
R(n::Integer)
R(f::fmpz)
R(f::fmpq)
```

Coerce an integer or rational value into the number field.

```
R(f::fmpq_poly)
```

Coerce the given rational polynomial into the number field, i.e. consider the
polynomial to be the representation of a number field element and return it.

```
R(f::nf_elem)
```

Take a number field element that is already in the number field and simply
return it. A copy of the original is not made.

In addition to the above, developers of custom number field types must ensure
that they provide the equivalent of the function
`base_ring(R::AnticNumberField)` which should return `Union{}`. In addition to
this they should ensure that each number field element contains a field
`parent` specifying the parent object of the number field element, or at least
supply the equivalent of the function `parent(a::nf_elem)` to return the parent
object of a number field element.

## Conversions

If $R$ is the polynomial ring to which the generating polynomial of a number
field belongs, then we can coerce number field elements into the ring $R$ using
the following function.

```
R(b::nf_elem)
```

Coerce the given number field element into the polynomial ring $R$ of which the
number field is a quotient.

Here are some examples of conversions from number field elements.

```
R, x = PolynomialRing(QQ, "x")
K, a = NumberField(x^3 + 3x + 1, "a")

f = R(a^2 + 2a + 3)
```

## Basic manipulation

```

## Arithmetic operations

Nemo provides all the standard field operations for number field elements, as
follows.

Function                         | Operation
---------------------------------|----------------
-(a::nf_elem)                    | unary minus

R, x = PolynomialRing(QQ, "x")
K, a = NumberField(x^3 + 3x + 1, "a")

c = a^2 + 2a - 7
d = 3a^2 - a + 1

f = c + d
g = c - d
h = c*d
k = 3*c
l = d*ZZ(4)
m = d*(ZZ(4)//3)
n = 4 - c
p = divexact(c, 5)
q = divexact(ZZ(4)//5, d)
r = c^4
```

## Comparison

Nemo provides the comparison operation `==` for number field elements. Julia
then automatically provides the corresponding `!=` operation. Here are the
functions provided.

Function
-----------------
==(a::nf_elem, b::nf_elem)

In addition, the following ad hoc comparisons are provided, Julia again
providing the corresponding `!=` operators.

Function
----------------------
==(a::nf_elem, b::Integer)
==(a::nf_elem, b::fmpz)
==(a::nf_elem, b::fmpq)
==(a::Integer, b::nf_elem)
==(a::fmpz, b::nf_elem)
==(a::fmpq, b::nf_elem)

Here are some examples of comparisons.

```
R, x = PolynomialRing(QQ, "x")
K, a = NumberField(x^3 + 3x + 1, "a")

c = 3a^2 - a + 1
d = a^2 + 2a - 7

c != d
c == 3a^2 - a + 1
c == 3
ZZ(4) == d
ZZ(5)//7 != c
```

## Inversion

```

Here are some examples of inversion.

```
R, x = PolynomialRing(QQ, "x")
K, a = NumberField(x^3 + 3x + 1, "a")

c = 3a^2 - a + 1

d = inv(c)
```

## Norm and trace

```

Here are some examples of computing the norm and trace.

```
R, x = PolynomialRing(QQ, "x")

c = 3a^2 - a + 1

d = norm(c)
f = trace(c)
```
